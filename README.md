# Project-week-6

# The idea
Following our classes on scraping sites and automatic scraping, I wanted to practice this and see if I could do it myself.
I wanted to examine whether hotel prices on booking.com in Hamburg, Germany, where I live, vary during different times of the day/week.

# Scraping
I used Soma's class guidance to scrape the website of booking.com. It was quite a challenge to find the price and hotel names in the
inspector, because it contained so much code.
